How do we split up the work?
============================

We have each person working on a different class or set of methods, detailed assignment is below

Donny: setters and getters, Face class, low level representation of cube, putting everything together

Kevin: Cube class, rotation in cube, initializing cube object, print and set cube values

Jason: parsing files to create cube, low-level rotation, main() code

Together: randomizing method, testing code



What do we have so far?
=======================

We are able to successfully implement and _debug_
- represent the cube in appropriate data structures
- face rotation 
- 2D representation print-out
- Parse text file to create cube
- respond to different movement commands
- geneartion of randomized cubes


Things taken into consideration
==============================
- efficiency
- exceptions and error-preventing
- abstraction
- interface, encapsulation
