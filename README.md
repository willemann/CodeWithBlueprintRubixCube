Members:

How do we split up the work?
============================

We have each person working on a different class or set of methods, detailed assignment is below

Donny: setters and getters, main files and packaging
Kevin: Cube class, rotation in cube, initializing cube object
Jason: parsing files, low-level rotation, main() code



What do we have so far?
=======================

We are able to successfully represent the cube in appropriate data structures, print out the cube, rotate faces correctly.
- face rotation 
- 2D representation print-out


Things taken into consideration
==============================
- efficiency
- exceptions and error-preventing
