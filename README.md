How do we split up the work?
============================

We have each person working on a different class or set of methods, detailed assignment is below

Donny: setters and getters, main files and packaging, putting everything together

Kevin: Cube class, rotation in cube, initializing cube object, print and set cube values

Jason: parsing files to create cube, low-level rotation, main() code

Together: randomizing method, testing code



What do we have so far?
=======================

We are able to successfully represent the cube in appropriate data structures, print out the cube, rotate faces correctly.
- face rotation 
- 2D representation print-out

Parse text file to create cube, correctly represetn and print out the cube, code it to respond to different movement commands, geneartion of randomized cubes


Things taken into consideration
==============================
- efficiency
- exceptions and error-preventing
